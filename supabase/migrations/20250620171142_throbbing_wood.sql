  # Temporarily disable RLS on profiles table to fix signup issues

  1. Disable RLS on profiles table
  2. This allows profile creation during signup
  3. We'll re-enable with proper policies once signup is working

  Note: This is a temporary fix to resolve the immediate signup issue.
  In production, you would want to re-enable RLS with proper policies.
